Such changes will often affect the capability of the printer to service certain types of print jobs. Management applications may cache infrequently changed configuration information about sub units within the printer. This object should be incremented whenever the agent wishes to notify management applications that any cached configuration information for this device is to be considered 'stale'. At this point, the management application should flush any configuration information cached about this device and fetch new configuration information. The following are examples of actions that would cause the prtGeneralConfigChanges object to be incremented: - Adding an output bin - Changing the media in a sensing input tray - Changing the value of prtInputMediaType Note that the prtGeneralConfigChanges counter would not be incremented when an input tray is temporarily removed to load additional paper or when the level of an input device changes.

prtChannelInformation,1.3.6.1.2.1.43.14.1.1.9,octet string,read-only,objecttype,column,"Auxiliary information to allow a printing application to use the channel for data submission to the printer. An application capable of using a specific PrtChannelType should be able to use the combined information from the prtChannelInformation and other channel and interface group objects to 'bootstrap' its use of the channel. prtChannelInformation is not intended to provide a general channel description, nor to provide information that is available once the channel is in use. The encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation object is specific to channel type. The description of each PrtChannelType enum value for which prtChannelInformation is defined specifies the appropriate encoding and interpretation, including interaction with other objects. For channel types that do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value shall be null (0 length). When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is registered, its accompanying description must specify the encoding and interpretation of the prtChannelInformation value for the channel type. prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same manner as described in section 2.4.1 for type 2 enumeration values. The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a collection of channel attributes, represented as text according to the following rules: 1. The prtChannelInformation is not affected by localization. 2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries representing the attribute values. Each entry consists of the following items, in order: a. A keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z) represented by their NVT ASCII [RFC854] codes, that identifies a channel attribute, b. The NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign (=) (code 61) to delimit the keyword, c. A data value encoded using rules specific to the PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies which must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the NVT ASCII Line Feed code), d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code 10) to delimit the data value. No other octets shall be present. Keywords are case-sensitive. Conventionally, keywords are capitalized (including each word of a multi-word keyword) and since they occupy space in the prtChannelInformation, they are kept short. 3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is represented by multiple entries with the same keyword, each specifying one value. Otherwise, there shall be at most one entry for each attribute. 4. By default, entries may appear in any order. If there are ordering constraints for particular entries, these must be specified in their definitions. 5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists of text represented by NVT ASCII graphics character codes. However, other representations may be specified: a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation value contains information not normally coded in textual form, whatever symbolic representation is conventionally used for the information should be used for encoding the prtChannelInformation value. (For instance, a binary port value might be represented as a decimal number using NVT ASCII codes.) Such encoding must be specified in the definition of the value. b. The value may contain textual information in a character set other than NVT ASCII graphics characters. (For instance, an identifier might consist of ISO 10646 text encoded using the UTF-8 encoding scheme.) Such a character set and its encoding must be specified in the definition of the value. 6. For each PrtChannelType for which prtChannelInformation entries are defined, the descriptive text associated with the PrtChannelType enumeration value shall specify the following information for each entry: Title: Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port name', 'Service Name', etc. Keyword: The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or 'Service' Syntax: The encoding of the entry value if it cannot be directly represented by NVT ASCII. Status: 'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally Mandatory' Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate whether the entry may be present multiple times. Description: Description of the use of the entry, other information required to complete the definition (e.g.: ordering constraints, interactions between entries). Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should ignore unrecognized entries, so they are not affected if new entry types are added."
